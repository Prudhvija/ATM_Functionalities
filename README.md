# ATM_Functionalities

Hello Friends , 
               Here I have developed a Simple ATM project using C++ including some functionalities of OOPS ( OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE) 
               The functionalities are: 
                                       1) Check balance: The user can check the account balance.
                                       2) Cash WithDraw: User can Withdraw cash from the ATM, but the only condition is user must enter the valid input, like the amount to be withdraw should be less than account balance. 
                                       3) User Details: User can see and cross check details with bank.
                                       4) Update Mobile no. :The user can update mobile number linked to the bank account.
